# fwsec

**nftables + CrowdSec firewall manager** — a CSF-style command-line interface for managing a modern Linux firewall.

fwsec is distributed and maintained as an independent project. This repository contains all source code, configuration templates, and installation resources required to use it.

> Supported systems: Ubuntu 24+ · Rocky Linux 8 / 9 / 10

## Quick install

No git required — the installer downloads the latest fwsec release by itself:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdbrsaulobrito/fwsec/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```

When piped like this the install is non-interactive: detected inbound ports and safe outbound defaults are applied automatically. To answer the interactive prompts (port selection, container policy), download the installer first and run it from a terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdbrsaulobrito/fwsec/main/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```

## Updating

```bash
sudo fwsec --upgrade
```

fwsec checks the GitHub repository for a newer release; when one is available it downloads it and updates the code, features, and executable. **Local configuration is never overwritten**: `fwsec.conf`, the allow/deny/ignore lists, and the temporary-block state in `/etc/fwsec` stay exactly as they are, and the rules are reloaded from them after the update. If nothing newer exists, it reports that fwsec is up to date. (`sudo bash install.sh --upgrade` remains available and does the same.)

## Installation from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hdbrsaulobrito/fwsec.git
cd fwsec
sudo bash install.sh
```

| Flag | Behavior |
|---|---|
| *(no flags)* | Installs fwsec. If it is already installed, displays its status and exits. |
| `--upgrade` | Queries the GitHub repository for the latest version. When a newer release is available, downloads it and upgrades the package and executable while preserving configuration files; otherwise reports that fwsec is up to date. |
| `--force` | Performs a complete reinstallation. |

The installer also detects competing firewalls — **firewalld** and **UFW** on any supported distribution, plus legacy iptables rule-restore services (`iptables.service`, `netfilter-persistent`) — and stops, disables, and masks them, so nftables is managed exclusively by fwsec. The post-installation check fails loudly if either firewall is still active.

### Interactive port selection

During installation, the installer scans the system with `ss` and lists every service currently listening (port, protocol, and service name). It then asks which ports to keep open for each direction:

- **Inbound TCP / UDP** — defaults to the detected listening services. The SSH port is detected automatically and always stays open.
- **Outbound TCP** — suggests `80,443,53,853` (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, DNS-over-TLS).
- **Outbound UDP** — suggests `53,123,443` (DNS, NTP, QUIC/HTTP3).

At each prompt, press Enter to accept the suggestion, type a comma-separated list (ranges like `8000:8080` are allowed), or type `none`. The choices are written to `/etc/fwsec/fwsec.conf`. In non-interactive shells the detected inbound ports and the safe outbound defaults are applied automatically. If `fwsec.conf` already exists, the installer asks before reconfiguring ports.

### Hosting control panels (cPanel / Plesk)

The installer detects **cPanel/WHM** and **Plesk**. When one is found, it shows a recommended service-port profile based on the panel's official firewall requirements and asks whether to apply it:

- **Apply the profile** (default, and automatic in non-interactive installs) — common TCP/UDP ports for mail, FTP, DNS, webmail, and the panel UI (2082–2096 for cPanel; 8443/8447/8880 for Plesk) are pre-opened. Remove ports for services that are disabled or not used.
- **Open on demand** — decline the profile and fall through to the regular minimal port selection; add panel ports later by editing `/etc/fwsec/fwsec.conf` and running `fwsec -r`.

The SSH port is detected separately and always stays open in either mode.

## Quick reference

### Firewall lifecycle

```bash
fwsec -s          # Start the firewall
fwsec -f          # Stop the firewall and flush its rules
fwsec -r          # Restart or reload the rules
fwsec -e          # Enable fwsec
fwsec -x          # Disable fwsec
fwsec -c          # Validate the configuration
fwsec -l          # List loaded rules and allowed ports (in/out, TCP/UDP)
fwsec -v          # Show fwsec, CrowdSec, and nftables versions
```

### Deny IP addresses

```bash
# Block permanently
fwsec -d 1.2.3.4
fwsec -d 1.2.3.4 "SSH attack"
fwsec -d 192.168.0.0/24 "Suspicious network"

# Block temporarily
fwsec -td 1.2.3.4 3600                  # 1 hour
fwsec -td 1.2.3.4 86400 "Brute force"  # 24 hours
fwsec -td 1.2.3.4 300 "Port scan"      # 5 minutes

# Remove a permanent block
fwsec -dr 1.2.3.4

# Remove a temporary block
fwsec -tr 1.2.3.4

# Show active temporary blocks
fwsec -t
```

### Allow IP addresses

```bash
# Add to the allow list
fwsec -a 1.2.3.4
fwsec -a 1.2.3.4 "São Paulo office"
fwsec -a 10.0.0.0/8 "Internal network"

# Remove from the allow list
fwsec -ar 1.2.3.4
```

> Allow-listed IP addresses have the highest priority and are accepted before every blocking rule, including CrowdSec rules.

### Search for an IP address or domain

```bash
fwsec -g 1.2.3.4         # Search every list and CrowdSec
fwsec -g 192.168.1.0/24  # Search for a CIDR range
fwsec -g example.com     # Resolve the domain and search for its IP addresses
```

The result identifies whether the address appears in `fwsec.allow`, `fwsec.deny`, temporary blocks, or CrowdSec decisions.

## nftables architecture

fwsec operates with two parallel nftables tables:

```text
Inbound packet
      |
      v
+---------------------------------------------+
| table inet fwsec / chain whitelist          | priority -100
| ip saddr @allow4 -> ACCEPT immediately      |
+---------------------------------------------+
      | (not allow-listed)
      v
+---------------------------------------------+
| table inet fwsec / chain blacklist          | priority -50
| ip saddr @deny4 -> DROP                     |
+---------------------------------------------+
      | (not deny-listed)
      v
+---------------------------------------------+
| table inet filter / chain input             | priority 0
| established/related -> ACCEPT               |
| @crowdsec-blacklists -> DROP                |
| tcp dport <SSH> -> ACCEPT                   |
| policy: DROP                                |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

- **`@allow4` / `@allow6`** — sets managed by `fwsec -a`
- **`@deny4` / `@deny6`** — sets managed by `fwsec -d` and `fwsec -td`, with native timeouts
- **`@crowdsec-blacklists`** — sets managed automatically by the CrowdSec bouncer

The same allow/deny sets are also enforced on the **forward hook** (`whitelist_forward` at priority -100 and `blacklist_forward` at -50), so bans and allow rules cover traffic that is NATed to containers and never traverses the input hook.

## Container hosts (Docker / Podman / nerdctl)

Ports published by a container (`-p 80:80`) are DNATed before the input hook, so a conventional host firewall never sees that traffic — this is the classic "Docker bypasses the firewall" problem. fwsec addresses it natively:

- **Bans always reach containers.** The `fwsec -d` / `fwsec -td` deny sets and CrowdSec decisions are enforced on the forward hook as well, so a banned IP cannot reach a published container port.
- **`CONTAINER_MODE = 1`** keeps the main forward chain permissive (container networking keeps working) while still dropping CrowdSec-banned sources on forwarded traffic. With `CONTAINER_MODE = 0` the forward chain drops everything, which is correct for hosts without containers.
- **`CONTAINER_POLICY = filtered`** additionally restricts every externally published container port to the fwsec allow list: `fwsec -s` discovers the published ports at start time and builds a `containers` chain (priority -60) that drops new connections to them from any source not in `@allow4`/`@allow6`. Matching uses the original (pre-NAT) destination port via conntrack. `open` (the default) keeps Docker's normal behavior.
- **Container-aware commands.** `fwsec -l` lists port mappings of running containers (flagging localhost-only bindings), `fwsec -g IP` reports whether an IP belongs to a container or a container network, and `fwsec -c` warns when a runtime is detected but `CONTAINER_MODE` is off, and when published ports are unrestricted.
- **Safe persistence.** fwsec persists only its own tables to `/etc/nftables.conf`, never the full ruleset — persisting everything would freeze the dynamic rules Docker/Podman manage and restore stale copies of them at boot.

### Installer behavior on container hosts

During installation, fwsec detects Docker, Podman, and nerdctl. When a runtime is found (or when you answer that you plan to run containers later), the installer:

1. Enables `CONTAINER_MODE = 1` so the firewall never breaks container networking.
2. Lists the ports currently published by running containers.
3. Asks whether published ports should be restricted to the allow list (`CONTAINER_POLICY = filtered`).
4. Adds the detected container network subnets to `fwsec.ignore`, so internal container traffic is never banned (a busy internal proxy is a classic false positive).
5. Offers to enable CrowdSec log acquisition for containers (`/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/fwsec-docker.yaml`, using `use_container_labels: true`), so attacks against containerized applications also generate bans. Label your containers (e.g. `crowdsec.labels.type=nginx`) so CrowdSec parses their logs with the right collection.
6. Prints default security recommendations: bind internal-only services to localhost (`-p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432`), never expose the engine socket (`docker.sock`), prefer rootless mode, and keep images from trusted registries.

## CrowdSec integration

When `SYNC_DENY = 1` (the default), `fwsec -d` and `fwsec -td` also create CrowdSec decisions:

```bash
fwsec -d 1.2.3.4 "SSH attack"
# -> nftables set deny4: immediate block
# -> cscli decisions add --ip 1.2.3.4: propagated to the bouncer

fwsec -td 1.2.3.4 3600 "Brute force"
# -> nftables set deny4 timeout 3600s: expires automatically
# -> cscli decisions add --duration 3600s
```

Show active CrowdSec decisions:

```bash
cscli decisions list
cscli alerts list
cscli metrics
```

## systemd service

```bash
systemctl status fwsec        # Show service status
systemctl start fwsec         # Start
systemctl stop fwsec          # Stop
systemctl restart fwsec       # Restart
systemctl enable fwsec        # Enable at boot
systemctl disable fwsec       # Disable at boot
journalctl -u fwsec -f        # Follow logs
```

## Practical examples

```bash
# Block an attacker for 24 hours and record the reason
fwsec -td 203.0.113.99 86400 "SSH brute force detected"

# Permanently allow an office IP address
fwsec -a 177.20.10.5 "Rio de Janeiro office"

# Check every list before allowing an IP address
fwsec -g 203.0.113.99

# Permanently block the address after investigation
fwsec -d 203.0.113.99 "Confirmed malicious"

# Reload every rule after manually editing fwsec.allow
fwsec -r

# Show the complete firewall state
fwsec -c && fwsec -l
```
